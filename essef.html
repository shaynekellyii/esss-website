								The purpose of the ESSEF is to enrich the educational experience of SFU undergraduate engineers by providing funds to support innovative projects, entrepreneurial ventures, and representation at engineering conferences and competitions.

						<p>
							Since its inception in 1997, the ESSEF has seen much growth. Virtually all the interest earned from the capital of the fund is used to enrich the educational experience of SFU’s engineers by helping to fund student projects. The growth of the ESSEF is primarily due to the support of students, faculty, and local corporations.
						</p>
						<p>
							To past, present, and potential donors: Many innovative projects have been realized by our engineers with the assistance of ESSEF funding. With continued support of the endowment fund, more projects will be able to receive funding each semester to pursue projects with more ambitious scope than ever before.
						</p>
						<p>
							To potential employers: Upon graduation, SFU engineers already have had the chance to delve into development of innovative technology. Project experience is invaluable, as it enhances a student’s education with he opportunity to apply classroom knowledge to a real-world problem. For more information on donations, please contact the ESSEF Director, essef@esss.ca.

							The Engineering Science Undergraduate Student Project Awards may be given annually for projects proposed by SFU Engineering Science undergraduate students. The project proposals submitted for consideration should contain a description of the project, Category as noted below, the benefits to Engineering Science students, the university or to industry, an implementation schedule including a deadline and a contact student who is registered, and a complete cost breakdown. The project can fall into one of four (4) Categories that will be ranked according to the Rating Criteria (first criteria being the highest).

				  		<p>Each semester, the Funding Council will inform the School of Engineering Science students of the existence of the Awards, and will invite project proposals to be considered for the Awards by the end of the third (3) week of classes. The Engineering Science Undergraduate Student Project Awards will be granted by the Senate Undergraduate Awards Adjudication Committee on the nominations of the Funding Council and the Director of the School of Engineering Science. In addition to the Term of Reference noted on each reminder notice, all students must be meet the following criteria for awards:</p>
				  		<ul>
				  			<li>A minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00 during the term of the contribution and the student must not be on academic probation</li>
				  			<li>Registration in a minimum of 9 credit hours of normal graded courses in the term of eligibility; graduate students must be registered for residence credit in an approved program</li>
				  			<li>Only one intervening term will be allowed between the term in which the student makes their contributions and the term in which the application is received in Financial Assistance</li>
				  			<li>Remunerated or assigned activities such as financed research, course assignments, teaching duties, etc. are not considered, except where contributions are over and above usual expectations</li>

			  			<p>Parts purchased using money from the Engineering Science Student Endowment Fund remain property of the ESSS. As such, we’ve managed to accumulate quite a large selection of parts over the years. These parts can be borrowed for use in projects via the same application criteria as the endowment fund, but with no distinct deadline as it is controlled year-round by the ESSS rather than run through Financial Aid. All borrowers of parts must provide a deposit of market value for the parts, and must return the borrowed part by the set deadline for the deposit to be returned.</p>
			  			<p>For a current list of parts and to arrange an application for borrowing of parts please contact the ESSEF Director (essef@esss.ca).</p><br>

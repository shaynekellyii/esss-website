This repository contains the markup for the website of the SFU Engineering Science Student Society. I set out to re-design the website from its existing Wordpress based form.

The design of the website is inspired by Google's Material Design vision. This is accomplished thanks to the open source CSS framework called Materialize, which you can find on Github at https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize.
